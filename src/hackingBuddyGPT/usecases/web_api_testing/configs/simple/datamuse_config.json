  "description": "**Disclaimer** - This *OpenAPI* specification is generated with the tool *RESTSpecIT*, which leverages *GPT* Large Language Models. Even though the tool verifies as much as possible the model responses, mistakes and/or inaccuracies may be found in the generated specification. Thus, data such as the license or the e-mail of the API should still be manually verified. Moreover, invalid API parameters are often ignored in *nearly* valid requests, as RESTful APIs tend to apply the **robustness principle**. This principle states that *programs receiving messages should accept non-conformant input as long as the meaning is clear*. As the validity of such parameters is complicated to verify, some described parameters may result in false positives. Query parameters that were found but did not specify a value have their type set to **x-null**.<br><br>**Be Reassured** - The tool *RESTSpecIT* has been thouroughly tested on various APIs, demonstrating an average route and parameter discovery rate of over x%. Additionally, the tool is capable of discovering undocumented features of APIs, which was verified with x of the tested APIs.<br><br>**API Description** - The Datamuse API is a service that provides access to a vast collection of linguistic data for various applications and language-related tasks.",
